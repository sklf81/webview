# webview
Webview is an web-application to view your filesystem in the browser.
## What can it do?
Webview displays the current working directory (CWD), the directory where the [webview.php](https://github.com/sklf81/webview/blob/main/webview.php)-file is located.
You can click through the child-directories of the CWD and download any file that is displayed.
It's not possible to view the parent-directory of the CWD - because of security.
